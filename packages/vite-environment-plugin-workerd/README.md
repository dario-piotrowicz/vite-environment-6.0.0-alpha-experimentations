# Vite Environment Plugin Workerd

Package that exports a `workerdEnvironmentProvider` function that can be used to set a Vite Environment to run code inside the [`workerd` runtime](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) (via [`Miniflare`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/miniflare)).

> Note:
>  the package is called `vite-environment-plugin-workerd` that's not a valid name, I kept is as such just for now in order
>  not to have too big of a diff in these experimentations
>  TODO: rename package
