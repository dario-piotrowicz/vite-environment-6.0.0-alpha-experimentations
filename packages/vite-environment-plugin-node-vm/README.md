# Vite Environment Plugin Node-VM

Package that exports a `nodeVmEnvironmentProvider` function that can be used to set a Vite Environment to run code inside a [Node.js `vm` module](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html).

> Note:
>  the package is called `vite-environment-plugin-node-vm` that's not a valid name, I kept is as such just for now in order
>  not to have too big of a diff in these experimentations
>  TODO: rename package
